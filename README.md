# Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition

This project is an **Automated Attendance Management System (AAMS)** that leverages face recognition technology to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of student attendance in educational institutions.

## 📌 Features

- Face detection and recognition using **CNN**, **PCA**, and **Eigenfaces**
- Real-time camera capture and automated attendance marking
- User-friendly **Tkinter GUI**
- Attendance data stored securely in local files
- Generates **CSV reports** for each attendance session
- Security and privacy considerations with local data handling
- Simple model training and tracking functionality

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV** – Face detection & image processing
- **NumPy, Pandas** – Data handling
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Face recognition model (CNN)
- **Tkinter** – GUI interface
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Model training and visualization
- **Flask** *(for optional web-based deployment)*
- **SQL / CSV** – Data storage and management

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-face-recognition.git
   cd attendance-face-recognition
📊 Sample Outputs
Live face recognition feed

CSV report with ID, Name, Date, Time

🚀 Future Scope
Web interface using Flask or Django

Mobile app integration

Cloud storage for data and images

Multi-modal authentication (e.g., RFID + Face)

Integration with academic ERP systems

🛡 Security and Privacy
Data is stored locally and not uploaded online

Implements encryption and access control (extendable)

Compliant with basic data privacy practices
